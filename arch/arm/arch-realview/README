Introduction:
XenARM for ARM RealviewEB Board assumes it executes on top of u-boot, and 
have been developed and tested on QEMU environment. Since current QEMU is not 
properly emulating the flash memory of VersatilePB, you must apply patches 
into QEMU and u-boot. 
Please, refer http://thomas.enix.org/Blog-20081002153859-Technologie

Limitation:
- Only supports upper 64MB of RAM on board (0x04000000-0x08000000) 
  in order to avoid the conflict with domain creation codes in XenARM.
  I expect the conflict will be resolved by XenARM maintainers in near future.
- Impossible to use Secondary Interrupt Controller(SIC) 

Location of binaries (Physical Address)
- Xen			0x04008000
- Mini-OS 1		0x05c00000
- Mini-OS 2		0x06c00000
